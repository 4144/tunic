# Tunic

Install Linux on Windows without a Live USB.

The goal is a program that can install Linux on an existing Windows machine without need of a Live USB or making firmware/BIOS changes.

## Status

This project is pre-alpha quality.
We do not suggest you use on real hardware; use inside a virtual machine or on a computer you don't care about damaging.

### Requirements

* Windows 10, 64 bit
* Single unencrypted hard drive hosting the C: volume
* UEFI
* At least 4 GB RAM
* At least 15 GB of free disk space on C:
* Administrator user permissions
* Internet access
* AC Wall Power

### Limitations

* Currently, Tunic only installs [Linux Mint with Cinnamon, 64 bit](https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3832).
* We are working on support for Windows 7 and 8, and other Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distros.
* There are no short term plans for MBR or 32 bit support.
* Error handling needs improvement.  A failed install could leave the system in an undesirable state.
