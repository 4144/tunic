Install Linux on Windows without a Live USB

The goal is a program or script that can install Linux on an existing Windows workstation without a LiveUSB or booting into Linux.

## Status

This project has just started and is simply a proof-of-concept.  It is of low quality.
Do not run any of the included scripts directly.
It would be better to copy paste them line-by-line and google each command to understand what it does.
